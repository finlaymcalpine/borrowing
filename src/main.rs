// When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values,
// we wonâ€™t need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.

// BORROWING is the act= of creating a reference. If we try to modify something we've borrowed, it will fail.
// if we try to call this change function on &s1, we're told that parameter is a reference and is not mutable.
// References, as with variables, are immutable by default.

//fn change(s: &String) {
//    s.push_str(", world!");
//}

// we can change a value being referred to if we define it as a mutable reference as below. the restriction is that only one mutable 
// reference can be made to a value at a time. The base value does need to be mutable.

fn mutable_refs(s: &mut String) {

}

// We don't have dangling pointers in Rust, because the compiler will only allow references within the same scope as the data they refer to
// We can't, for example, return a reference to a value from a function, if the value was created inside the function. In that case,
// the value is dropped when the function exits. So we could only return the value itself out of the function if created within.
